# 🧠 Face Emotion Recognition

This project uses a webcam to detect human faces and recognize their emotions in real time using deep learning. It leverages OpenCV for video capture and the facial_emotion_recognition library (based on PyTorch) to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprise, and more.

# 🔧 Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam
- Emotion recognition using pre-trained deep learning model
- Runs on CPU (no GPU required)

# 🚀 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- torch
- facial_emotion_recognition

# 📦 Installation

Run the following command in your terminal
```bash
>> pip install facial-emotion-recognition
>> pip install opencv-python torch
